## My blog 
The templates are based on Karl Broman's [Simple site: Easy websites with GitHub pages](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site) and the [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). 

GitHub allows the user to upload \*.md files (this site uses the `kramdown` flavour) and uses the integrated Jekyll to covnert them to regular \*.html.
