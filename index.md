The main purpose of setting this page up is to share how I applied the Design of Experiments (DoE) approach to fine-tuning the recipe for ořechovka, a semi-sweet, iodine-rich liquer made of non-ripe green wallnuts. 

- [Orechovka: the initial idea](pages/orechovka1.html)
- [Design of Experiment: how it works](pages/orechovka1.html)
- [placeholder: Chosing the most yummy recipe for orechovka with DoE](link)

As the time will pass, I may create another content here. For now, nonetheless, it is all about ořechovka.

This page was crated using Karl Broman's tutorial and templates that can be found [here](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site). I keep Karl's instructions here; start with the [Overview](pages/overview.html).
