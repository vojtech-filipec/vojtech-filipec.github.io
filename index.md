description: Minimal tutorial on making a simple website with GitHub Pages

This page was crated using a Karl Broman's tutorial and template that can be found [here](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site).

The main purpose of setting this up to share how I applied the Design of Experiments (DoE) approach to fine-tuning the recipe for OÅ™echovka, a semi-sweet liquer made of non-ripe green wallnuts.

To refer to Karl Broman's manual I keep the original pages here:

- [Making an independent website](pages/independent_site.html)
- [Making a personal site](pages/user_site.html)
- [Making a site for a project](pages/project_site.html)
- [Making a jekyll-free site](pages/nojekyll.html)
- [Testing your site locally](pages/local_test.html)
