This page was crated using a Karl Broman's tutorial and template that can be found [here](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site).

The main purpose of setting this up to share how I applied the Design of Experiments (DoE) approach to fine-tuning the recipe for OÅ™echovka, a semi-sweet, iodine-rich liquer made of non-ripe green wallnuts.

- [Orechovka](pages/orechovka1.html)
- [placeholder: part 2](link)
- etc

To refer to Karl Broman's manual I keep his original instructions here. Start with the [Overview](pages/overview.html).

I am thankful to Karl Broman for providing a great [tutorial on creating a simple_site](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site).
