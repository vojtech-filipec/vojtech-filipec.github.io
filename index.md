The main purpose of setting this page up is to share how I applied the Design of Experiments (DoE) approach to fine-tuning the recipe for o≈ôechovka, a semi-sweet, iodine-rich liquer made of non-ripe green wallnuts. 

- [Orechovka: the initial idea](pages/orechovka1.html)
- [Design of Experiment: how it works](pages/orechovka2.html)
- [placeholder: Chosing the most yummy recipe for orechovka with DoE](pages/orechovka3.html)

Secondly, I use this place to share ideas about puzzles/riddles/rebuses for small children who don't know reading, writing or arithmetics.

This page was crated using Karl Broman's tutorial and templates that can be found [here](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site). I keep Karl's instructions here; start with the [Overview](pages/overview.html).
