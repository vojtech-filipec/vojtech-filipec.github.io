This page collects various topics:

### Kombucha brewing

Kombucha got some prominence in the recent years, and this is [my take on it](pages/kombucha.md).

### The Best Ořechovka Ever prepared using Desing of Experiments

The original purpose of setting up this page up is to share how I applied the Design of Experiments (DoE) approach to fine-tuning the recipe for ořechovka, a semi-sweet, iodine-rich liquer made of non-ripe green wallnuts. 

- [Ořechovka](pages/orechovka1.html): the initial idea
- [Design of Experiment](pages/orechovka2.html): super-fast intro to how DoE works
- [Inputs to try for orechovka](pages/orechovka3.html): how I used common sense to reduce the list of possible factors
- [How to apply DoE in the search for recipe](pages/orechovka4.html)
- [Mixing, infusing, degusting](pages/orechovka5.html): practical steps
- [Data analysis](pages/orechovka6.html): what do the captured data say?
- [Recipe for the best ořechovka](pages/orechovka7.html): the recipe I infered from data

This page was crated using Karl Broman's tutorial and templates that can be found [here](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site). I keep Karl's instructions here; start with the [Overview](pages/overview.html).
