česky: Tato stránka obsahuje mé vlastní nápady na hádanky a šifry pr oděti, které ještě neumí číst, psát ani počítat. Budu rád za vaše [komentáře a tipy na vylepšení](https://github.com/vojtech-filipec/vojtech-filipec.github.io/issues/new). Většinu dojmu sdělí obrázky, proto se omezím na stručné anglické popisky.

It is a fun for me to prepare challenges for kids’ minds and then to watch them immersed in the search for solution, be it at home when you appreciate a period of silence for your own, let alone when travelling on a bus/train for a long period of time. Nonetheless, it may be a challenge for the adults to come up with a task that **requires neither writing, reading nor arithmetics** which are common ingredients of all possible playbooks. 

This page shall be an inspiration for anyone who wants to serve kids’ minds with **simple-to-solve challenges**.

I believe a picture has the power of thousand words, so I will not post many comments here. On the contrary, you are encouraged to [share your hints and improvements](https://github.com/vojtech-filipec/vojtech-filipec.github.io/issues/new). 

## Incomplete map
Get any map and draw parts of it to a new sheet of paper. You do not have to draw each and every detail - it is sufficient to copy significant marks like railways, lakes, etc. Small hole in each tile displays a letter from the underlying map if placed correctly; rank of the letter in the keyword is on the tile. The initial 99 % of time needed for solving this about looking for a place at map. Eventually, nonetheless, the task requires a bit of reading at the end to get the keyword.
